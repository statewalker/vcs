/**
 * History - Immutable repository history (Part 1 of Three-Part Architecture)
 *
 * The History interface provides unified access to all stored objects:
 * - Blobs: File content
 * - Trees: Directory structures
 * - Commits: Version snapshots
 * - Tags: Annotated version markers
 * - Refs: Named pointers (branches, tags)
 *
 * History is:
 * - Immutable: Objects are content-addressed and never change
 * - Shared: Multiple working copies can share the same history
 * - Persistent: Survives application restarts
 *
 * History does NOT include:
 * - Staging area (belongs to Checkout)
 * - Working directory (belongs to Worktree)
 * - HEAD pointer (belongs to Checkout)
 *
 * @see HistoryWithBackend for advanced operations (GC, delta, serialization)
