/**
 * Storage Operations - Low-level storage APIs for optimization and transport
 *
 * This module provides the StorageOperations interface for delta compression
 * and Git-compatible serialization. These operations are NOT part of the main
 * History interface - they're for:
 *
 * 1. **DeltaApi** - Blob delta operations for storage optimization (GC, repacking)
 * 2. **SerializationApi** - Git-compatible wire format I/O (transport, interop)
 *
 * For typed access to Git objects, use the History interface:
 * ```typescript
 * import { createMemoryHistoryWithOperations } from "@statewalker/vcs-core";
 * const history = createMemoryHistoryWithOperations();
 * const commit = await history.commits.load(commitId);
 * ```
 *
 * For storage operations, use HistoryWithOperations:
 * ```typescript
 * const history = createMemoryHistoryWithOperations();
 * // Delta operations
 * history.delta.startBatch();
 * await history.delta.blobs.deltifyBlob(blobId, baseId, deltaStream);
 * await history.delta.endBatch();
 *
 * // Serialization operations
 * const pack = history.serialization.createPack(objectIds);
 * await history.serialization.importPack(receivedPackStream);
 * ```
