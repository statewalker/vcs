/**
 * Blob Delta API - Delta operations for blob objects only

 * Blobs (file content) benefit most from delta compression since:
 * - They comprise 90%+ of repository storage
 * - Same files across commits delta very well
 * - Large files benefit significantly from delta compression
 *
 * Trees and commits are stored as-is (no delta tracking) because:
 * - They're typically small (100B - 10KB)
 * - Fast access is more important than marginal space savings
 * - Delta chain resolution adds latency for every tree/commit read
