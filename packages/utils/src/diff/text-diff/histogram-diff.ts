/**
 * An extended form of Bram Cohen's patience diff algorithm.
 *
 * This implementation was derived by using the 4 rules outlined in
 * Bram Cohen's patience diff blog post, and then was further extended
 * to support low-occurrence common elements.
 *
 * The basic idea of the algorithm is to create a histogram of occurrences for
 * each element of sequence A. Each element of sequence B is then considered in
 * turn. If the element also exists in sequence A, and has a lower occurrence
 * count, the positions are considered as a candidate for the longest common
 * subsequence (LCS). After scanning of B is complete the LCS that has the
 * lowest number of occurrences is chosen as a split point. The region is split
 * around the LCS, and the algorithm is recursively applied to the sections
 * before and after the LCS.
 *
 * By always selecting a LCS position with the lowest occurrence count, this
 * algorithm behaves exactly like Bram Cohen's patience diff whenever there is a
 * unique common element available between the two sequences. When no unique
 * elements exist, the lowest occurrence element is chosen instead. This offers
 * more readable diffs than simply falling back on the standard Myers' O(ND)
 * algorithm would produce.
 *
 * To prevent the algorithm from having an O(N^2) running time, an upper limit
 * on the number of unique elements in a histogram bucket is configured by
 * {@link setMaxChainLength}. If sequence A has more than this many elements
 * that hash into the same hash bucket, the algorithm passes the region to
 * the fallback algorithm. If no fallback algorithm is configured, the region
 * is emitted as a replace edit.
 *
 * So long as maxChainLength is a small constant (such as 64), the algorithm
 * runs in O(N * D) time, where N is the sum of the input lengths and D is
 * the number of edits in the resulting EditList.
 *
 * This implementation has an internal limitation that prevents it from handling
 * sequences with more than 268,435,456 (2^28) elements.
