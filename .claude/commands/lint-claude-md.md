Validate the CLAUDE.md and .claude/* files for consistency:

1. Check all `[Full Guide]` links in CLAUDE.md resolve to existing files
2. Verify `.claude/sources.md` exists (since it's referenced)
3. Check for TODO/FIXME markers in `.claude/*` files
4. Verify CLAUDE.md contains these required sections: Project Overview, Conventions, Code Quality, Testing, Workflows, Common Pitfalls, Self-Maintenance
5. Report any issues found with file paths and line numbers
